## Code of Conduct

Be respectful, collaborative, and constructive. We're building tools to help the Zcash ecosystem, and we welcome contributors of all skill levels.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Linux (Ubuntu 22.04+), WSL, or macOS
- Docker Engine ≥ 24.x + Compose v2
- 2 CPU cores, 4GB RAM, 5GB disk
- Git

### Setup Development Environment

```bash
# Fork and clone
git clone https://github.com/Supercoolkayy/ZecKit.git
cd ZecKit

# Run setup
./scripts/setup-dev.sh

# Start devnet
docker compose up -d

# Verify
./docker/healthchecks/check-zebra.sh
./tests/smoke/basic-health.sh
```

---

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-123
```

Branch naming conventions:
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation only
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Test improvements

### 2. Make Changes

- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Update documentation as needed

### 3. Test Locally

```bash
# Run smoke tests
./tests/smoke/basic-health.sh

# Check logs
docker compose logs

# Clean restart
docker compose down -v && docker compose up -d
```

### 4. Commit

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add health check retry logic"
```

Commit message format:
```
<type>: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

### 5. Push and Create PR

```bash
git push origin feature/my-feature
```

Then open a Pull Request on GitHub.

---

## Coding Standards

### Shell Scripts

- Use `#!/bin/bash` shebang
- Enable strict mode: `set -e`
- Add comments for non-obvious logic
- Use meaningful variable names
- Make scripts executable: `chmod +x`

### Docker / Compose

- Pin image versions (no `latest` tags)
- Bind to localhost (`127.0.0.1`) for exposed ports
- Use health checks for all services
- Document any non-standard configurations

### Documentation

- Use Markdown for all docs
- Keep README.md updated
- Add inline comments in configs
- Document security considerations

---

## Testing

### Required Tests

All PRs must pass:

1. **Smoke tests:** `./tests/smoke/basic-health.sh`
2. **Health checks:** `./docker/healthchecks/check-zebra.sh`
3. **CI pipeline:** GitHub Actions workflow must pass

### Adding New Tests

When adding features, include tests:

```bash
# Add test to tests/smoke/
nano tests/smoke/my-new-test.sh

# Make executable
chmod +x tests/smoke/my-new-test.sh

# Verify it works
./tests/smoke/my-new-test.sh
```
